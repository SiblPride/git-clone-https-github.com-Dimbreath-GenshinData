There's been a lot of misunderstandings going around as of late regarding certain drama, so this will be explaining every success and where I will be talking about only from my side as I don't want to involve anyone else. Now, whether the repository will be up again or not, for now I don't know.

First of all, no, the leaks are time gated to build up hype not to "gain attention to earn money" as some people has been spreading around and to avoid MiHoYo to react the way they did yesterday which was probably due to the amount of content that was leaked by "unknown" parties. 

My Ko-Fi and Patreon exist *(and existed for years, at least for the Ko-Fi, Patreon was from when I released Ganyu back in January)* because I develop and maintain three *(and one private)* bots that amount up to 25,000 Discord servers, over 1.5 million members and processing all four of them over 3 million messages per day and also game data repositories that people use to make their websites, bots, applications, etc. The Ko-Fi and Patreon have been there for **if** people wanted to support the work I did, reverse engineering, maintaining, and updating bots isn't easy and hosting isn't cheap either especially not where I am from. The bots are free to use, with no locked or paid features and so is the game data repositories which you can easily find on my GitHub. It makes me feel like all the work I did is being belittled because of all the people spreading lies.

And even then, the fact that there's people that's belittling and minimizing the fact of what has been an entire month of work for us is also kind of irritating, considering the amount of time and effort that it takes.

The events that happened:

1) Around two days ago, MiHoYo made a really bad mistake which was making the 1.5 beta files publicly available for people to download, that is if people knew were to look at since these files are usually locked. BigBoss and their team got aware of this and started downloading the client and then posting/reuploading the client in multiple servers so many people got ahold of the client. 

2) A few more days later, as I mentioned above, stuff started to be posted. Right after that, those "unknown" parties started to mass posting memory dumped content from that client, nearly every single thing was leaked by that people.

3) Hours later MiHoYo released a bit more serious than the usual tweet / statement regarding the content that has been leaked on both their English and Japanese Twitter, probably due to nearly the entirety of the 1.5 patch being available at that point. A bit weird coming from them because of the fact they were the ones that made the mistake that lead to hundreds of people to download the beta client easily.

4) Again a few hours later, MiHoYo yet again with one of their worst mistakes so far: They released a development build of the beta, and guess what? Also publicly. What they say and do doesn't really correllate, pretty dumb to not take measures since this isn't the first time this happens either. 

The same BigBoss group started spreading the link around and reuploading it *(as far as I'm concerned they now have public mirriors too)* and is what they're using to post these leaks that have been spread around lately. This is the same client you can see on one of these big ""leakers"" called NEP NEP (@nep_impact) *[(by the way, if you're gonna block me for no reason and then reupload what others tweet at least have the face to delete the watermark like you used to do before.)](https://i.imgur.com/dAYmt4a.png)* or any of the other pictures that have been going around lately.

Now, their reasoning to do this is unknown to me, to harass me and posting these videos insulting me which then were reposted on a lot of Genshin Impact servers and communities in which some people were also making fun of that, then add the follow up tweets and DMs with even more harassment towards me. I suspect it's what I mentioned above early on this message. I've been told that they also said I'm stealing something but I'm not sure what they're on, everything that came from me is something I did myself with my group for my own learning and enjoyment and as I stated on this repository, to provide content for people to build APIs, websites, bots, applications, etc. I never talked with that BigBoss person until I told them to stop spreading misinformation about me and what I do on a public Discord server, the same place where they've been called out multiple times by other members and where later they've been banned by me. [But I mean, they don't seem to care much about the community after all and have ulterior motives to do what they're doing.](https://i.imgur.com/rdOxVIJ.png) With that said, [I'm not sure for how much longer they can keep giving you content](https://i.imgur.com/bD45ZIu.png) because when this beta ends that client won't be really useful to them anymore, I assume. So unless Mihoyo makes such a mistake all over...

[I just hope they don't repent of what they're doing and shift blame like it happened before if stuff starts to get rough.](https://i.imgur.com/dXce2ab.png)

Also, I must say, using a development build in the way they're using it and also mirroring it for anyone to download it... Clearly shows how naive some people is.
